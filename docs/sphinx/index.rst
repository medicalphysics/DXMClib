DXMClib
===================================
DXMClib (Diagnostic X-ray Monte Carlo) is a radiation dose scoring library for diagnostic photon energies in voxelized geometry written in C++. The main goal for this library is to provide an accurate enough physics model to describe and model x-ray sources and estimate radiation doses by the Monte-Carlo method.

If you are looking for an application with graphical user interface to perform simulations, OpenDXMC_ uses this library as Monte Carlo engine and also allows for import CT images and phantoms as scoring volumes.

Example of usage
-----------------
A brief example on how to use DXMClib to simulate a pencilbeam of 60 keV onto a box of aluminum surrounded by water and air is shown below. 

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/pencilbeam/pencilbeam.cpp
   :language: c++
   :linenos:

The examble can be built by CMake with the following CMakeLists.txt file.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/pencilbeam/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: cmake
   :linenos:
